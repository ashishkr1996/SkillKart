Mortgage 
What is mortgage?
A mortgage is a loan from a bank or a financial institution that helps the borrower purchase a house. A mortgage is secured by the home itself, so if the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank can sell the home and recoup its losses. Mortgage payments are usually monthly and consist of four components: principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
Types of Loans
•	Conventional Loans : A conventional loan is a mortgage that is not guaranteed or insured by any government agency

•	FHA (government insured loans) (Federal Housing Administration): loans extended by FHA-approved lenders typically are designed to assist borrowers unable for various reasons to get the approval necessary for conventional home loans.

•	VA  ( Loans provide only to the veterans) : special, often discounted, home loans designed exclusively for military veterans.
•	USDA( Provided to people from rural area)
Stages through which a Loan proceeds
•	Origination 
•	Servicing 
•	Default
ORIGINATION:
•	Choose the property
•	Path through which borrower wants to borrow the loan
a)	Retail - The practice of lending directly to and working directly with a borrower ( Banks, credit unions, mortgage bankers )
b)	Wholesale (also referred to as Broker) - institutions that do not deal directly with consumers, but offer their loans through third parties such as mortgage brokers, credit unions, other banks, etc. In this type of lending, the wholesale lender is the one that is actually making the loan and whose name typically appears on loan documents. The third party - bank, credit union, or mortgage broker- in most cases is simply acting as an agent working with the borrower for a fee.
c)	Correspondent - This happens after the loan is issued (funded to borrower). This is the sale/purchase of mortgages to an investor who will collect the payment and “service” the loan
•	Complete the loan application(1003/URLA – Uniform Residential Loan)
•	Provide necessary documents/information to lender
•	Then lender will verify from it’s own end and here the underwriter comes into picture. Mortgage underwriting  is the process Lender Evaluates the Loan Application for Approval. The terms that underwriters consider fall under the three C’s of underwriting: credit, capacity and collateral.
a)	Credit Report: Credit is what the underwriter uses to review how well a borrower manages his or her current and prior debts. The credit report provides information such as credit scores, the borrower’s current and past information about credit cards, loans, collections, repossession and foreclosures and public records (tax liens(lien : a formal, legal symbol of money owed on a major asset such as property. Also, mortgage), judgments and bankruptcies).It will scale from 0-1000 i.e if the credit score is towards 1000 it will be easy to provide the loan to the borrower and if it is towards 0 then the borrower will have to go through many stages before he is provided the loan.
b)	Appraisal Report :  There are Certain Third Party vendors/ Title Companies that are involved in verifying the property insights. The property is properly authenticated of its correct market value, mortgage insurances and other calculated deliverables. The verification allows generation of Appraisal Reports that is passed on to the Lender for further processing and loan disclosures.
            Reports are generated for the following verification
               i)  Verification of Mortgage
   ii) Verification of Employment
   iii)  Verification of Identity
   iv) Verification of Deposit



c)	Background Verification :  The personal details are verified by a third party Underwriter, these underwriters calculate the borrower’s income, assets using a common platform software, i.e. LoanSphere Empower. Using the product, borrower’s Social Security Number (SSN), Income Details, Tax Returns are verified. A Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR) is produced that contains the verified details for the Borrower. VOE (VERIFICATION OF EMPLOYMENT) and VOI (VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY) is done. Alternative Documentation (The use of pay stubs, W-2 forms, and bank statements in lieu of Verifications of Employment (VOE) and Verifications of Deposit (VOD) to qualify a borrower for a mortgage.) are also provided.
•	Property valuation completed and meets needs
•	Agree to rate (Variable rate/ARM(adjustable rate mortgage): (Mortgage loans under which the interest rate is periodically adjusted based upon terms agreed to at the inception of the loan) or Fixed rate(The type of loan where the interest rate will not change for the entire term of the loan))  /term / payment / costs of loan

•    Lock rate (a short-term agreement by a lender to “hold” a certain interest rate on a home loan while the buyer negotiates a sale transaction. Also, Rate commitment option) / term with lender
•	Loan gets originated

SERVICING :
•	Amount is credited to borrower’s account then the borrower will start paying EMI.
•	EMI involves PITI( Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)
a)	Principal :  The amount borrowed on a home loan.
       b) Interest :  This is calculated based upon the rate that the borrower has locked during the              origination period weather fixed or variable rate. In the variable rate we can put CAP (The limit placed on adjustments that can be made to the interest rate or payments such as the annual cap on an adjustable rate loan (ARM)/variable rate or the cap on a rate over the life of the loan.)
        c) Taxes :   Annual local taxes charged against the value of a homeowner's           property.
        
d)	Insurance : insurance many homebuyers are required to purchase, particularly when they are unable to put down a certain dollar amount on the loan; protects the lender in the event of borrower default.

DEFAULT  : 
Let’s say borrower is not able to make payment & it has been 90 days that he hasn’t  payed  his EMI then his/her loan will come under default. Under this two condition will come  :
1)	When he hasn’t declared himself bankrupt. That is when LMD will take place. Following are the process that come under LMD :
•	Short Scale: The phenomenon in which the Borrower may sell its property and repays the due Loan amount.
•	Re-Financing: Borrower can re-finance the loan by adjusting principal amount. Re-finance fees is applicable in order to re-finance the loan.
•	Adjusting or reducing the interest rate
2)	When he is declared bankrupt i.e even after going through LMD he/she is not able to pay his debt back then the following process will come into picture:
•	Foreclosure: Third party sale would occur and the bank would forcefully seize the property kept as collateral and try to recover the loss by selling it in an auction.
•	Real Estate Owned (REO): In case of an unsuccessful foreclosure auction, the mortgaged property is owned by the Lender/Investor companies. Lender can list REO at Lender’s website. There no role of the real estate agents after REO by Lender. Generally this stage is avoided 


After the loan installments are fulfilled, the lender officially closes the Loan. There are Attorney/Settlement Agent/Title Agent who verifies and provides the consent for loan closing. The Lender officially Hand overs the property to the Borrower/Property Owner.
Closing Reports are documented and Merges Closing Package with Original Credit File.
